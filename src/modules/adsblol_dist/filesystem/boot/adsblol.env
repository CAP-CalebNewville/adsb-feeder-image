#
# define the location, timezone, and UUID of your feeder
#
# example:
#
# FEEDER_LAT=38.89796
# FEEDER_LONG=-77.03656
# FEEDER_ALT_M=19
# FEEDER_TZ=America/New_York
# FEEDER_UUID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
#
# you can find the name for the right timezone here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
# if you keep the default 'all 0s' UUID, a random one will be created for you
# remove the '#' at the beginning of each line with the 'FEEDER_...' variables and set the correct values.
# note that the altitude above mean sea level is in meters. You can find this for example at this website:
