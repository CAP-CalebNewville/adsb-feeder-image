<p>The Config Backup creates a zip file with your configuration settings,
  the Config + Graphs Backup additionally includes the data used to generate the statistical graphs (roughly +15MB),
  the Full Backup adds on top of all that the replay / heatmap data.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of historic replay / heatmap data you have, a Full Backup can take a signficant amount of time and
  result in a very large archive to be downloaded. If you don't have enough free diskspace the full backup may fail.</p>
