# adsb-feeder-image

Easy to use turn-key SD card image for RPis (and hopefully soon some other SBCs) to run an ADS-B feeder 
that feeds the large "open data" ADS-B flight trackers (currently [adsb.lol](http://adsb.lol), [adsb.one](http://adsb.one), [adsb.fi](http://adsb.fi),
[planespotters.net](http://planespotters.net), and [TheAirTraffic.com](http://theairtraffic.com).

The goal of this project is to make things as simple as possible for the non-technical user.

- buy a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 (oh, wow, first major hurdle - those are _hard_ to find)
  (hopefully very soon I'll have tested versions for other, easier to find boards)
- download the latest image from the Release section
- use a tool like the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-imager/releases) to write the image to a ÂµSD card on your computer
- only use the 'wifi setup' option to make sure the image can connect to your wifi - everything else should be kept unchanged
- boot from the image
- wait a couple of minutes for the initial boot to complete, then connect to the [ADSB-PI Setup Page](http://adsb-pi.local:5000) -- this link
_should_ work to find the freshly booted system on your local network - assuming you have a reasonably standard setup with mDNS enabled. 
Otherwise you'll need to figure out its IP address which is a lot harder...
- on the setup website enter the latitude, longitude, and elevation of your receiver
- there's a convenient button to get the correct time zone from your browser
- click on Submit and then be patient while everything gets installed and setup - depending on your internet speed this could take several minutes
- once you are back to the Setup page, you can go to the main [feeder website](http://adsb-pi.local:8080) and you should see the aircraft that you 
are tracking. And in the background, all these plane positions are fed to the main open data ADS-B flight trackers.


# for developers

This repo actually contains the scripting to create the SD card image for RPis and hopefully some 
other SBCs to run an ADS-B feeder. And as 'releases' it publishes such images.

This requires [CustomPiOS](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS) - unpack this next to the 
`CustomPiOS` folder in order for the scripts to work.

I'll add more detail here shortly ðŸ¤£
